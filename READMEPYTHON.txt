README TEXT TO BE ADDED:

Run the python file to take a text file containing a book's text and generate the three separate
text files, allwords.txt, uniquewords.txt, and wordfrequency.txt for further processing.

The only other thing that needs be done is define the file name and/or directory location of the
text file being processed if using one other than the one provided (Pride and Prejudice).
